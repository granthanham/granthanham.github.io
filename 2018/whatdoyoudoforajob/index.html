                <p>Why can this so hard to answer? The trick part of the question is the &lsquo;what&rsquo;, it may be better to focus on the why.</p>

<p>Yes, I stumbled my way through a bad response to an apparently simple and totally expected question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umm&hellip; I still haven&rsquo;t managed to be able explain it to my parents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is an example of a particularly bad response because the focus is on the what.</p>

<p>My neighbour&rsquo;s response is that he&rsquo;s a toaster technician. He runs a company that installs automated gates. This template response is normally thrown out to ensure that in a social setting  people don&rsquo;t ask him to fix their gate or remote control or key panel or &hellip; You get the point. After knowing the guy for years, I know that people are buying a feeling of security for them, their families and possessions. I also know that the thing that keeps him going day in and day out is the feeling he gets when people see that they have more than they expected. He really is a fit and finish type of guy.</p>

<p>So my day job is a bit technical in nature and my focus is often on how I&rsquo;m going to solve the next problem. To be blunt, this is of little interest to any else other than the muses in my head.</p>

<p>But there is a story that truly depicts what on earth I&rsquo;m trying to achieve on a day to day basis.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I was buying an item from my local motorcycle store. Because I had known Richard (the salesman) for a long time I signalled that he address the frantic customer who had just entered the store. The customer was wanting to trade his motorcycle for one the store had in store. He had driven to the store in a car because the reason for the upgrade was so that he could take her on trips with him. In the matter of what seemed like seconds Richard had determined the make, model, year and condition of the bike to be traded. Richard made a trade in offer sight unseen and calculated the residual to be paid. Then turns to me and state that I didn&rsquo;t want brand X but brand Y because they had a massive sale on the item.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trying to get rid of old stock are we Richard?&rdquo; I quipped back, in reference to both the trade in deal and my item of purchase.</p>

<p>Richard is a large, elderly man who looks like he has worked in motorcycle shops all his life. The next exchange surprised, resonated and inspired me.</p>

<p>Richard looked me dead in the eye and said &ldquo;People underestimate the cost of product sitting on he shelf&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I used to underestimate it too. But one day someone showed me a spreadsheet that showed the cost of holding stock and the time. And it&rsquo;s a lot less than anyone would think&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve come to realise is that people&rsquo;s intuition about numbers is very poor. In fact it&rsquo;s basically wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not until someone does the statistical model and it&rsquo;s put in a way that people can see and understand it that people can make the right decisions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So&hellip;</p>

<p>That is what my answer is going be next time. I help people understand the things that are hard to intuit and allow them to make better decisions.</p>
